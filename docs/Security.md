# Security

## Introduction

Security is a crucial aspect of developing and deploying decentralized applications (dApps). Ensuring the security of smart contracts, backend servers, and frontend applications is essential to protect user assets, data, and the integrity of the application. In this document, we'll cover security considerations, best practices, and specific measures we have implemented in the RealmDomains project.

## Smart Contract Security

### Common Vulnerabilities

1. **Reentrancy**:
   - **Description**: Reentrancy occurs when an external contract calls back into the vulnerable contract before the first invocation is completed, potentially causing inconsistent state.
   - **Mitigation**: Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern and reentrancy guards (e.g., OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`).

2. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**:
   - **Description**: Integer overflow or underflow occurs when arithmetic operations exceed the maximum or minimum value a variable can hold.
   - **Mitigation**: Use SafeMath libraries (e.g., OpenZeppelin's `SafeMath`) to perform arithmetic operations safely.

3. **Unchecked Call Return Values**:
   - **Description**: Failing to check the return value of low-level calls (e.g., `call`, `delegatecall`, `send`) can lead to unexpected behavior.
   - **Mitigation**: Always check the return value of low-level calls and handle errors appropriately.

4. **Access Control**:
   - **Description**: Improper access control can allow unauthorized users to perform restricted actions.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement proper access control mechanisms using modifiers (e.g., `onlyOwner`) and role-based access control (e.g., OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl`).

### Best Practices

1. **Code Audits**:
   - Conduct regular code audits and security reviews to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
   - Consider hiring external security firms to perform independent audits.

2. **Testing**:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to ensure the correctness of smart contracts.
   - Use tools like MythX, Slither, and Echidna for automated security analysis.

3. **Upgradability**:
   - Consider implementing upgradable smart contracts to fix vulnerabilities and add features without redeploying the entire contract.

### Example: Secure Smart Contract

**DomainMarketplace.sol**:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract DomainMarketplace is ReentrancyGuard {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    struct Domain {
        string name;
        uint256 price;
        address owner;
        bool forSale;
    }

    mapping(string => Domain) public domains;

    modifier onlyOwner(string memory name) {
        require(domains[name].owner == msg.sender, "Not the domain owner");
        _;
    }

    function listDomain(string memory name, uint256 price) public {
        require(price > 0, "Price must be greater than zero");
        domains[name] = Domain(name, price, msg.sender, true);
    }

    function buyDomain(string memory name) public payable nonReentrant {
        Domain storage domain = domains[name];
        require(domain.forSale, "Domain not for sale");
        require(msg.value >= domain.price, "Insufficient payment");

        address payable seller = payable(domain.owner);
        seller.transfer(msg.value);

        domain.owner = msg.sender;
        domain.forSale = false;
    }

    function getDomain(string memory name) public view returns (Domain memory) {
        return domains[name];
    }
}
```

## Backend Server Security

### Common Vulnerabilities

1. **Injection Attacks**:
   - **Description**: Injection attacks occur when untrusted data is inserted into a query or command, leading to unexpected behavior.
   - **Mitigation**: Use parameterized queries and sanitize user input.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
   - **Description**: XSS attacks occur when malicious scripts are injected into web pages viewed by other users.
   - **Mitigation**: Escape and sanitize user input, use Content Security Policy (CSP).

3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:
   - **Description**: CSRF attacks occur when unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts.
   - **Mitigation**: Use CSRF tokens to validate requests, implement proper session management.

### Best Practices

1. **Use HTTPS**:
   - Ensure all communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS.

2. **Validate and Sanitize Input**:
   - Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.

3. **Implement Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

4. **Security Headers**:
   - Use security headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `Strict-Transport-Security` to enhance security.

### Example: Secure Backend Server

**backend/server.js**:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const helmet = require('helmet');
const { ethers } = require('ethers');
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
const contractABI = require('../artifacts/contracts/DomainMarketplace.sol/DomainMarketplace.json').abi;

dotenv.config();

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.use(helmet()); // Use Helmet to set security headers
app.use(express.json());

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.INFURA_PROJECT_URL);
const contractAddress = process.env.CONTRACT_ADDRESS;
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, provider);
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, wallet);

app.post('/list-domain', async (req, res, next) => {
  const { domainName, price } = req.body;
  try {
    const parsedPrice = ethers.utils.parseEther(price);
    const tx = await contract.listDomain(domainName, parsedPrice);
    await tx.wait();
    res.status(200).send({ message: 'Domain listed successfully!' });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error listing domain:", error);
    next(error);
  }
});

app.post('/buy-domain', async (req, res, next) => {
  const { domainName, price } = req.body;
  try {
    const parsedPrice = ethers.utils.parseEther(price);
    const tx = await contract.buyDomain(domainName, { value: parsedPrice });
    await tx.wait();
    res.status(200).send({ message: 'Domain purchased successfully!' });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error buying domain:", error);
    next(error);
  }
});

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send({
    error: {
      code: err.code || 500,
      message: err.message || 'Internal Server Error',
    }
  });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

## Frontend Security

### Common Vulnerabilities

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
   - **Description**: XSS attacks occur when malicious scripts are injected into web pages viewed by other users.
   - **Mitigation**: Escape and sanitize user input, use Content Security Policy (CSP).

2. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:
   - **Description**: CSRF attacks occur when unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts.
   - **Mitigation**: Use CSRF tokens to validate requests, implement proper session management.

3. **Insecure Dependencies**:
   - **Description**: Using outdated or vulnerable dependencies can expose the application to various attacks.
   - **Mitigation**: Regularly update dependencies and use tools like `npm audit` to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

### Best Practices

1. **Use HTTPS**:
   - Ensure all communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS.

2. **Validate and Sanitize Input**:
   - Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.

3. **Implement Security Headers**:
   - Use security headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `X-Frame-Options` to enhance security.

4. **Regularly Update Dependencies**:
   - Regularly update dependencies to the latest versions and use tools like `npm audit` to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

### Example: Secure Frontend

**src/index.js**:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

**src/App.js**:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import DomainForm from './components/DomainForm';
import DomainList from './components/DomainList';
import GlobalStyle from './styles/GlobalStyle';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <GlobalStyle />
      <h1>RealmDomains</h1>
      <DomainForm />
      <DomainList />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) can help mitigate XSS attacks by restricting the sources from which your application can load resources such as scripts, styles, and images.

#### Content Security Policy (CSP)

A Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security feature that helps prevent a range of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. By specifying the allowed sources of content, CSP provides a way to mitigate the risk of malicious scripts being executed.

**Example CSP Header**:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const helmet = require('helmet');
const app = express();

// Use Helmet to set security headers
app.use(helmet());

// Set custom Content Security Policy
app.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
    scriptSrc: ["'self'", "https://apis.google.com"],
    styleSrc: ["'self'", "https://fonts.googleapis.com"],
    imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https://images.example.com"],
    connectSrc: ["'self'", "https://api.example.com"],
    fontSrc: ["'self'", "https://fonts.gstatic.com"],
    objectSrc: ["'none'"],
    upgradeInsecureRequests: [],
  },
}));

// Other middleware and route handlers...

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

In the example above, the CSP header is configured to:
- Allow scripts to be loaded only from the same origin (`'self'`) and `https://apis.google.com`.
- Allow styles to be loaded only from the same origin and `https://fonts.googleapis.com`.
- Allow images to be loaded from the same origin, data URIs, and `https://images.example.com`.
- Allow connections to be made only to the same origin and `https://api.example.com`.
- Disallow loading of fonts from any sources other than the same origin and `https://fonts.gstatic.com`.
- Disallow embedding of objects.
